  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">About Popper</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Popper is a platform for posting conjectures and refutations, with bounties to incentivize rigorous rational criticism. Anyone can create a conjecture, set a bounty, and invite others to challenge their claim. Accepted refutations are rewarded from the bounty pool.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How Bounties Work</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
    <li>Anyone can contribute to a conjecture's bounty pool.</li>
    <li>The conjecture creator can accept a refutation, marking the conjecture as refuted and awarding the bounty to the refuter.</li>
    <li>All transactions are transparent and recorded on the platform.</li>
  </ul>
