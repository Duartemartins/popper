  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">About Popper</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Popper is a platform for posting conjectures and refutations, with bounties to incentivize rigorous rational criticism. Anyone can create a conjecture, set a bounty, and invite others to challenge their claim. Accepted refutations are rewarded from the bounty pool.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Anonymisation Settings</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    When creating an account, you can choose your preferred display name setting:
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
      <li><strong>Anonymous</strong>: Your identity is hidden and only an anonymous label is shown.</li>
      <li><strong>Username only</strong>: Only your chosen username is displayed.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Name</strong>: Your first and last name are shown.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Name with Title</strong>: Your full name and professional title are displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    You can change your anonymisation preference in your account settings at any time.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How Bounties Work</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
    <li>Anyone can contribute to a conjecture's bounty pool using ETH.</li>
    <li>The conjecture creator can accept a refutation, marking the conjecture as refuted and awarding the bounty to the refuter.</li>
    <li>All transactions are transparent and recorded on the platform.</li>
    <li><strong>For security and anti-abuse:</strong> Admins must currently approve all bounty payouts before funds are released. This prevents fraudulent or accidental payouts and ensures the integrity of the platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Organisations</h2>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
    Popper supports organisations, which are groups that users can belong to. Organisations can represent research groups, companies, teams, or communities. As a member of an organisation, you can:
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
      <li>Collaborate on conjectures and refutations with other members.</li>
      <li>Share bounties and recognition within your group.</li>
      <li>Manage organisation settings and membership (if you have admin privileges).</li>
    </ul>
    You can join or create organisations from your account dashboard. Each user can belong to one organisations, and your contributions will be attributed to both you and your organisation. Bounties are paid out to the wallet chosen by the user.
